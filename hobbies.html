                <h2>Kayaking</h2>
                <p>This is my newest hobby, but the one that brings me the most excitement. The reason for this is my discovery of Oru Kayaks, a brand of kayak that folds up into the size of a suitcase. They're easy to store, unpack, and manuever. I can't recommend this brand enough! Check them out for yourself by clicking <a target="_blank" href="https://www.orukayak.com/">here.</a></p>

                <h2>Guitar</h2>
                <p>I've been playing guitar since highschool, but I would still consider myself an amateur. I've always preferred the soft coziness of the acoustic guitar, but I also appreciate the versatility and punchiness of the electric as well. </p>

                <h2>Wood Burning</h2>
                <p>This is a pretty niche hobby that I fell in love with a few years ago. Take a design, a slab of wood, and a soldering pen, and you can make something pretty cool. This is my favorite piece that I've made:</p>
